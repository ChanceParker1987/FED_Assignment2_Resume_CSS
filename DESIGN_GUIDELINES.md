My favorite colour is blue, so my selections reflect that.

1. Background-color: #D6EAF8 - This colour is mostly white but with a
subtle blue tint to it.

2. Block-color: #5DADE2 - This is an icy blue that I like, it will       provide the main block colour.

3. Font/Contrast colour: #154360 - This is a darker navy blue that will provide good contrast to the lighter blues for fonts and accents.
